# AzureCasts
Screencasts, but for Azure

## The Structure
It's critical that these screencasts:

 1. Solve a problem, roundly
 1. Are no longer than 15 minutes
 1. Do not contain the words "cool" or "umm"
 1. Keep a brisk pace so that someone with < 5 years development can keep up
 1. DO NOT SELL ANYTHING

## Structure
Ryan Bates set the bar super high with his amazing, small tidbits of Rails knowledge. There's no need to reinvent what worked so well, so to that end we follow this flow:

 1. **Just start**. No introductions, no flash, just state the problem we're going to solve clearly
 1. **The Punchline**. Tell people within 10 seconds precisely what they're going to see, and show the result.
 1. **Define the Problem Clearly**. Build the case within 30 seconds. If you can't split the screencast into multiple screencasts.
 1. **Solve the Problem Simply**. Go in steps. Break the overall problem into simpler ones, solve each.
 1. **Go Deeper**. The final part is the most fun. Now that we've solved the problem, take 2 minutes to show possible improvements, followup things for people to go do, or deeper reasons why the problem exists.

## Recording
Ideally you'll use ScreenFlow so we can help edit each other's stuff and we'll have the same effects. That said, we're not robots and we all know how to reach an audience in our own way.

Resolution should be 1280/720 and I should be able to watch this comfortably in landscape on my phone while on the bus on the way to work.

Audio should be as crisp and clear as you can make it. Perfection isn't required, but a quiet room with a pop filter and normalization should happen.

All code should be added so that people can easily follow along.

We'll host on Youtube so people can find it, but embed the video in our own site. 

## Example
Here are some great examples of what we're trying to do:
