I have the simplest web application I can create successfully deployed to Azure, but that‚Äôs about it. There‚Äôs a lot more I need to do in order to make this a production-grade deployment, so in this episode I‚Äôm going to take the first step on that journey by setting up automated deployments and logging.

I‚Äôve upgraded my single file Node web application to a bare bones website built using the Express generator - Express being a rather popular NodeJS web framework. As you can see I haven‚Äôt changed the site at all - it‚Äôs exactly what the generator created for me. I‚Äôll add more features later on - right now I want to be sure I understand any error that comes my way.

## Setting Up Simple Logging

When it comes to logging I typically let an online service handle it for me - and there are plenty who are willing to take my cash. For instance Loggly, which I‚Äôve used quite a few times, is a reliable service that I like a lot. There‚Äôs also HoneyBadger and Skylight that step things up a bit and help you troubleshoot and tune your application as needed. 

I‚Äôll get there eventually, but for right now I want to see what I can do with Azure. I‚Äôll be using the CLI one more time, interrogating it so I can learn how to setup what I need. 
I‚Äôll start as I did before, looking at the various subcommands for `az webapp`:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_70" %}

The subcommands are listed in alphabetical order so it‚Äôs pretty easy to look under ‚Äúl‚Äù for logs - and there they are. Diving in again with `az webapp log -h` and I see the subcommands:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_69" %}

Seems straightforward. The one I‚Äôm interested in right now is `config` but `show` and `tail` will be useful to remember later on when I want to see the log output.
Let‚Äôs ask the CLI how to use `config` by executing `az webapp log config -h`:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_71" %}

That‚Äôs a lot of arguments that I can set, but the naming is pretty clear and the details help explain things in a reasonable way. Since I‚Äôm only investigating right now, I think it‚Äôs reasonable to basically turn _everything_ on.

Let‚Äôs double check the documentation to see if there are any gotchas.

I‚Äôll do a Google search using the term `az webapp log config` which will bring up the Microsoft documentation for the command. Right at the top I see something very useful: a command reference that I can copy and paste right into a script file! Scrolling down, however, there‚Äôs not much in the way of extra information here. In fact the documentation is simply echoing the argument name, which isn‚Äôt helpful.

That‚Äôs OK - I think I have what I need. I‚Äôll copy and paste the the command from the documentation and then set the arguments as I need.

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_73" %}

I‚Äôve turned everything on here as I want to see application logging and I want those logs to go to the filesystem as opposed to Azure storage. I want detailed error messages and failed request tracing so I can troubleshoot things if my application becomes unresponsive.

Finally, I‚Äôll be adding logging the application I created in the first episode - `velzyapp` - so I‚Äôll specify the name as you see here.

I can execute this script by loading it into my shell, which I can do using `source ./scripts.sh`. Once again Azure returns a JSON dump telling me that things were successful - my application is all set up for logging.

## Continuous Container Deployment

Now I want to enable continuous deployment. Just so it‚Äôs completely clear: I‚Äôm not talking about DevOps here or any kind of orchestration. What I want to enable is a simple pull of an updated image from DockerHub whenever I make changes. Let‚Äôs see if Azure can handle that scenario.

Once again, I‚Äôll have a look around the `az webapp` subcommands and - there it is - `deployment`:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_74" %}

Let‚Äôs see what kind of things this subcommand can do. I‚Äôll execute `az webapp deployment -h` and this time, thankfully, there are fewer commands to wade through:
{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_75" %}

I have a container-based deployment so let‚Äôs see what the deal is with the `container` sub-subcommand using `az webapp deployment container -h`:
{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_76" %}

Paydirt! Looks like the `config` sub-sub-subcommand (üòÜ) is exactly what we‚Äôre looking for. Right below that we have a command that will give us a URL to plugin to a web hook. We‚Äôll need that - so let‚Äôs remember it‚Äôs here.

OK let‚Äôs jump into `az webapp deployment container config -h` and see what we can learn:
{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_77" %}

To turn on continuous deployment, I simply need to set the `--enable-cd` argument to `true`. I don‚Äôt know what slots are just yet so I‚Äôll ignore that for now.
As with most `webapp` commands, I also need to send in the name and resource group arguments, so I‚Äôll do that now‚Ä¶ and I get an error because I need two dashes‚Ä¶ fixing that and I get some JSON back:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_78" %}

Great! We‚Äôre all set and we don‚Äôt even have to ask for the web hook URL, Azure was nice enough to send it back in the response.
That‚Äôs the last step - telling DockerHub to ping Azure whenever I push a new image. To do that, I need to go over to DockerHub where my image is hosted and, under ‚ÄúWebhooks‚Äù, I‚Äôll add the URL Azure just gave me:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_79" %}

Great! Now we‚Äôre ready to update our image.

## A Better Docker Image

In the last video I used the simplest Dockerfile I could make:

```bash
FROM node

COPY index.js ./

EXPOSE 3000 

CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

I did this, once again, because I wanted to make sure that I understood any failures as clearly as I could. Now it‚Äôs time to upgrade things some. 
As I mention, I‚Äôm now working with the NodeJS Express web framework and I‚Äôve generated a simple website. That means I need to rebuild my Docker image so it has all the packages and application code in my project.

To do that, I‚Äôll follow the suggestions on the NodeJS web site for how to properly create a Dockerfile:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_80" %}

I‚Äôll set the version of Node to the latest LTS, which is 10.10. I‚Äôll set the working directory to the standard `/usr/src/app` and then I‚Äôll copy the package files in. I‚Äôll run `npm install` to load up the Express packages, copy my application files and then finally set a default command of `npm start`. This is as simple as I can make this Dockerfile, which I like.
I‚Äôm also going to learn from my past mistakes by checking the port specification. Having a look in the `/bin/www` file, I can see the port is set as it should be, using the environment variable or a hardcoded value of 3000. Azure will automatically set a `PORT` environment variable for me, so it‚Äôs a good practice to use it when starting up your web application.

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_81" %}

I‚Äôll rebuild the image and run it to make sure it works‚Ä¶ which it does:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_82" %}

Great! Now I can push it to DockerHub and hope for the best:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_83" %}

## Viewing the Logs

I‚Äôll head over to to my site on Azure - this is the one I deployed in the last video, which is the canonical ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù app from the Node team. It‚Äôs still up there and nothing seems to have changed.

Let‚Äôs log in to Azure and see whet‚Äôs going on. Now that I‚Äôve enabled logging (and every option too) I should be able to see what‚Äôs happening with some clarity.
To remind ourselves, let‚Äôs ask `az webapp log` for help by passing in the `-h` flag. The subcommands come up again and I can see some choices for viewing the logs. The first is to download them as a zip file, which I don‚Äôt want. The second seems to be what I want: `show`, but the description says it‚Äôs for the configuration, which I don‚Äôt need. Finally, `tail` will start a live stream, which is _definitely_ what I want. 

Let‚Äôs make sure by running `az webapp log tail -h`. I have a feeling I‚Äôll need to pass in the usual application name using `-n` and resource group using `-g`, but I‚Äôm glad I had a look first because there are some other arguments I can send in that might prove useful: `--verbose` and `--debug`. I‚Äôm not debugging anything right now, but I _do_ want to see as much information as possible, so I‚Äôll set the `--verbose` flag.

Let‚Äôs give it a whirl:

```bash
az webapp log tail -n velzyapp -g velzy --verbose
```

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_84" %}

Alright! This is exactly what I want to see. It took a few minutes for the web hook to reach Azure, and then for Azure to start the pull and reload, but it looks as though everything is ready to go.

Let‚Äôs refresh the app up on Azure and see:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_85" %}

Victory is mine!

## A Few Tips and Tricks

Before I finish up I‚Äôd like to share a few tips and tricks for the command-line-inclined out there. One of the things I don‚Äôt like to do is to type commands repeatedly. To get around that, I use a `.env` file, which is a standard way of sharing environment variables for use in your shell.

I‚Äôll create one here in the root of my project using `touch`. Before I go _any_ further I‚Äôll want to be sure that this file does not get added to source control, so I‚Äôll add `.env` to my `.gitignore` file:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_86" %}

All kinds of settings and scripts can be added to a `.env` file, include API keys, database connection strings, and other sensitive environment information. Checking this into source control is a huge problem! Fortunately for me, I generated this `.gitignore` file using the `gi` command from the good people at gitignore.io, who already had an entry for `.env`. Go have a look at the project if you don‚Äôt know what it is. 

I use zshell for my shell instead of bash and one main reason I do is because of the ‚ÄúOh My Zsh‚Äù project - not quite sure how you say that. This project is great for developers because they take care of so many shortcuts and common tasks that developers use every day. They also have a rich plugin system that pumps up your shell‚Äôs functionality.
One such plugin is `dotenv`, which you see here. This plugin will load any `.env` file for you when you navigate into a directory, and it will set environment variables automatically. Really useful!

Speaking of, let‚Äôs finally get around to setting our environment variables. I‚Äôll set `APPNAME`, `RG` (for resource group) and `IMG` for DockerHub image.  I‚Äôll also setup an alias, which is a shortcut recognized by the shell. I‚Äôll set one called `logs` and set it equal to my `az webapp log tail` command. Instead of hardcoding the name and resource group of my app, I‚Äôll use the shell variables.

These will come in handy later on. Let‚Äôs navigate out and back in and use `printenv` to see if things got loaded up - and they did:
{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_87" %}

Great. Now I can run my `logs` alias, which is a lot less typing!
{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_89" %}

Using a scripts file like this is really helpful. You can pop aliases in there but you can also create you‚Äôre own generator scripts to create Azure resources as you need. That‚Äôs when these environment variables come in handy.

If you want to see what some of these shell scripts look like, head over to azx.ms:

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_90" %}

This is a site I put together with my fellow CDAs and is basically a script repository for creating Azure resources. I‚Äôll talk about this site in a later episode.
One last tip before you go: let‚Äôs talk about Make. If you don‚Äôt know what it is, Make is a build tool that comes bundled with most Unix-based systems. It allows you to orchestrate shell commands, which is precisely what we need. I‚Äôm a huge Make fan, so let‚Äôs take a moment and expand the Makefile we created in episode one.

I‚Äôll copy and paste the shell variables from script and drop them right at the top. I‚Äôll then add a `web` target (for starting my site) and a `logs` target, using the same `logs` command from my shell script. I have to use slightly different notation here for the variables, however, because each target runs in its own shell process, so I need to use this syntax so Make will expand them before executing the command.

{% include screenshot.html img="screenshot_91" %}

Now I can see my logs simply by running `make logs`. In a later episode I‚Äôll talk more about how we can use Make to create our resources on Azure, with a rollback feature if anything goes wrong.

That‚Äôs it for now, however - thanks for watching.
