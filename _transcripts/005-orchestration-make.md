I like working with the Azure Command Line Interface - also known as the CLI. I don’t know Azure very well and I find the help feature extremely useful when trying to create new Azure resources as I’ve been doing in the previous episodes.

There is a drawback, however, and that is that you can end up with a bunch of cryptic text strewn around your application or, worse yet, you forget what command you used to create a given resource and have to go through the discovery process again.

The good news, however, is that this is programming! As my friend K. Scott Allen says: the Azure CLI allows you to treat Azure like a programmable data center - I think that’s great. We can treat the commands that we write in the same way we would treat any code: we'll add it to a file, comment it, and organize it so it makes sense and executes correctly.

Today I'm going to organize the commands that I’ve been working with in the previous episodes. I’ll walk you through how I do things, from simple script files all the way to orchestrating things with Make.

If you’re not a CLI fan but are curious - hold on tight as this episode is for you!
