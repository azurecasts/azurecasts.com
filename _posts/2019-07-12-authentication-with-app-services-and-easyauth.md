Yes, yes I know I can "just use Passport" with a Node/Express application, but I wanted to explore what Azure's Auth service, informally known as EasyAuth, has to offer. In this video I turn the service on and setup login, logout, personalization and finally lockdown of protected resources. I had fun!
