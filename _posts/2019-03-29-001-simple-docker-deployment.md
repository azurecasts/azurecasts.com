In this video we’ll kick the tires on Azure and see if it will work as the production home of project I’ll be working on. I don’t have an application just yet, but one is in the planning. 

I want to start by doing the simplest thing I can think of: deploying the sample code from the Node “Getting Started” guide. I don’t want to deal with dependencies, build processes, or unit tests just yet. I want to do the least possible thing so I can isolate any problems I run into.
